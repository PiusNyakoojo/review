/*
	We will create a micro-library

	Advantages:
		- Small and hence easy to reason about the code
		- easy to test, not a lot of code to test
		- easy to reuse in other projects

	Disadvantages:
		- Some people complain that managing dependencies becomes trickier because you may have a lot of micro-libraries.
		- Versioning may get trickier as well
	
	The principles we will learn in this series applies to microlibraries, or huge libraries

	In this series we'll learn how to 
		- create a git repository, 
		- host it on github, 
		- create the library, 
		- publish it to npm,
		- create a whole test suite using Karma, Mocha and Chai
		- setup continuous integration
		- add ES6/ES2015 support using babel
		- integrate webpack
		- distribute this library in a form that is consumable by both the browser and node
