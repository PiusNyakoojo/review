    What should you test for a JavaScript function? 
    
    Here are a list of possible testing things:
        - Ensure the number of arguments passed to the function is the number expected
            - In general you should do this when you expect your function to behave differently
            depending on the number of arguments.
            - You could also do this if you're testing that something fails expected.
        - Ensure the type of arguments passed to the function is what is expected 
            - Do this to inform users of the function that a certain type is expected
        - Ensure the function behaves a certain way for valid input
        - Ensure the function behaves a certain way for invalid input
