/*
	TypeScript, ES6 and Transpiled Languages
	
	Transpile
		- To convert the syntax of one programming language, to another
		- In this case languages don't really ever run anywhere, but instead are processed by 'transpilers' that generate Javascript

	Traceur allows you to write ES6 code that is transpiled to ES5 for modern browsers

	Typscript is transpiled to javascript and introduces many things such as interfaces, static typing, and more..
