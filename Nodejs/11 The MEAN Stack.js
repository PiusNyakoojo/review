    DOM
        - The structure browsers use to store and manage web pages. (generally, a collection of C++ objects)
        - Stands for Document Object Model. Browsers give the Javascript engine the ability to manipulate
        the DOM.
        - The browser uses the DOM to render the webpage and gives access to javascript through some API calls
        to access to DOM.

    When the browser receives the string of html, it processes it once and builds the DOM, which is a hierarchy
    of HTML elements
