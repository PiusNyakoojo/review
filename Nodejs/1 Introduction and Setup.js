/*
	Introduction and the Goal of this course:

		- We'll discuss the V8 Engine (the javascript engine that's at the core of nodejs) and what Nodejs adds to the engine in order
			to expand the javascript language and turn it into something that we can use to write server code.

/*
	Command Line Interface (CLI):
		- A utility to type commands to your computer rather than clicking
		- e.g. Bash on Linux, Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows and other replacements...
		- using the command line interface is about knowing the commands and all the arguments they take and how you can
			string those arguments together to do what you want.
		- using modern web technologies means knowing how to use the CLI
		- If you're using windows you can also use PowerShell.
			- PowerShell is much more powerful, has more commands and is standardized the way linux and macs are.. for example
				you can use ls rather than dir.

	Arguments:
		- Values you give your program that affect how it runs. Essentially passing parameters to a function
