    Environment Variables
        - Sometimes called Path Variables
        - A variable that stores a path to some location on the computer.
        - When you need to run a program, the computer will look down those paths and see if that location
        knows how to run something.. for example go programs, java programs, etc.

    To show a list of environment Variables, use the command

        env 
    
    To show a list of the Go path Variables

        go env 

    GOROOT needs to be set to where you've installed Go. GOPATH needs to be set to where your workspace is.
    These are 2 required path variables that need to be set.
