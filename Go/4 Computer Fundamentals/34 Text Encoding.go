    We saw in the Numeral system videos how we represent quantities. How do we represent text in computers?
    (Computers store binary numbers easily because they have switches which are either on or off.)

    Hexadecimal is sometimes called
        - hex
        - 0x (prefix indicates it's hex)

    Octal
        - base 8 numbering system
        - sometimes called Oct
        - Octs are useful because we often times work with bytes, and bytes are just 8 bits.
