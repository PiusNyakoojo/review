    Computers like the Eniac used vacuum tubes to control on-off states. The eniac had ~18000 vacuum tubes.

    Moths used to fly into vacuum tubes because they were quite hot and gave off light. Moths were attracted
    to the light and so the moths would fly into the computer and short out the vacuums tubes. So people
    would have to go in and remove the bugs from the computer. That's how debugging was coined.

    From vacuum tubes, we moved to transistors. From transistors, we move to integrated circuits (IC).
    From ICs, we moved to silicon wafers which is used to construct integrated circuits.

    Silicon wafers are made from silicon that's extracted from sand.

    Intel stands for integrated electronics. They integrated integrated circuits (ICs) and formed
    microprocessors (CPUs). They brought in things like
        - Arithmetic logic unit
        - Control unit
        - Registers
        - Cache
    and they put it all on this single chip.
