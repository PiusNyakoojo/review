    The power switch is a representation of how computers work 0 or 1. Based on whether or not an electric
    current is flowing through a circuit, we can convey whether this portion of the circuit is on or off.

    With a single bit, we can convey 2 states: 0 or 1.
    With 2 bits, we can convey 4 states: 00, 01, 10, 11
    With n bits we can convey 2^n states.

    A computer checks whether billions of bits are on or off and this is how we can do cool stuff with it :D

    If we have the following encoding scheme:

        000 - A
        001 - B
        010 - C 
        100 - D 
        110 - E 
        101 - F 
        011 - G 
        111 - H 

    What does 001, 000, 100, 010, 000, 001 say?
