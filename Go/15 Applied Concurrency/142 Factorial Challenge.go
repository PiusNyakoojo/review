    Write the factorial function using channels. Why would you want to use channels to write a factorial 
    function?

    A goroutine, concurrency, and parallelism is helpful when you have a lot of processing to do. If I needed 
    to process thousands of factorial calculations, then putting them into a goroutine and running those 
    calculations concurrently and in parallel - using all of the CPU cores on my machine, will help those 
    calculations get done faster.
