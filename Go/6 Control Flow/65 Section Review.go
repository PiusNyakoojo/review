    What did I learn?
        - Switch statements
            - can have multiple conditions in each case separated by ",". For example
            case "Jenny", "Julie":
                fmt.Println("Hey ladies!")
            - Doesn't need to have condition. If there's no condition, the program will run from case to case
            starting from the top and the first one to evaluate to true will be executed. 
            - fallthrough keyword
                - by default, fallthrough is not activated. To fall through to the next case, you have to 
                specify this explicitly with the fallthrough keyword at the end of the case. 
                - the default case is not executed even if we use fallthrough to the case above the default. 
        - If statements
            -
