    A suite is a group of related specifications. Describe is a suite that contains it specifications.

    The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is when you write your test first, everything fails because you haven't 
    written anything yet, then you write the code to make your test pass, then you refactor your code as 
    you continue to add new features.
