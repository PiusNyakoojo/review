    Over the last century there has been a lot of research done to determine the exact measure
    of a line (the length of a line). 45 - 90 characters per line depending on the font. For the 
    web, ~65 characters per line is a good rule of thumb.

    Use measures as a factor for picking breakpoints.

    It's also important to make sure fonts are large enough to read across any device! Set the base 
    font to at least 16px and line-height: 1.2em.

    Depending on the context, you may even increase the font-size and line-height for text-heavy sites.

    In addition to choose major breakpoints, it's also important to decide to place minor breakpoints to 
    change things slightly.
