    Minimize the amount of time the user spends filling out a form.

    Form principles:
        - Make forms short and sweet; avoid redundant information and autofill as much as possible
        - Provide helpful prompts; we've used label elements so far
        - Provide immediate feedback; focus bar and instant validation

/*
    Empathy is very important. You need to see the world in other people's perspective.

    If the form is long, can you save it for later? This is especially important for eCommerce.

    Can you finish the form on a different device? That's anoter essential question to ask when designing a form.

        - How long?
        - Where can I access the form?
        - What does your product look like from outside of your company?
            - Most people think about it from within their organization. "Oh we have these legal requirements, 
                the tech team can only build this, the design team can do blah blah blah..."
            - Think from inside out makes sense when you're looking at the bounds of your company. But it doesn't 
                make sense when you're looking from externally.
            - A useful to technique to force yourself to think from outside in is to have someone roleplay the 
                role of a form.

    But remember, FORMS SUCK! KEEP THEM SHORT!

    Roleplaying the role of a form.
        - Give someone a form, and you act like a human and they are only allowed to respond with what the form 
            says.
        - Person: "Hi, I'm luke, I want to see if I'd get along with you."
        - Form: "First name."
        - Person: "Uhh.. okay Luke."
        - Form: "Last name."
        - Person: "Uhh.. Stevens."
        - Form: "Gender."
        - Person: "Male."
    
    This name/value pair in a database is not a human interaction friendly environment.

    Complicated passwords may be annoying but they're fairly common. You should always practice security.

    Registration tends to push users away. That is terrible.
        - Allow checking out as a guest!!!

    Suggesting products is fine.

    Name inputs for shipping addresses is also fine.

    How can we make forms fast easy and accurate?
        - Cheap
            - This is information we need to have in the form. It is critical.
        - Cut
            - We actually don't need it.
        - Postpone
