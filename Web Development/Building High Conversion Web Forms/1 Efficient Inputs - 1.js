    The simpler the form, the more conversions. Faster forms -> more conversions -> more users :)

    In order to start making better forms, you should start by critiquing forms or asking
        - "How would I make this simpler?
*/
/*
    - Change the form title?
    - Consolidate inputs?
        - Taking multiple fields and converting them to a single field
    - Better validation messages
    - Add more questions

/*
    Principles of well designed forms: 
        - Make the form quick and easy to finish
        - Prefill information the user has already entered
        - Autocomplete fields

    
    An example of a well-designed form is Amazon's 1-click ordering. Just a single button and you're done!

    Dropdown (<select>) menus kind of suck. 
        - They're nice if you want to provide a user with a pre-defined list of things to select from.
        - However, they're not flexible in terms of allowing a user to enter something that's not on the list.

    With a datalist (<datalist>), you have the convenience of a dropdown and the flexibility of a text input field.

        <input list="nanodegrees">
        <datalist id="nanodegrees">
            <option value="Android"></option>
            <option value="Senior Web Developer"></option>
            <option value="Tech Entrepreneur"></option>            
        </datalist>

/*
    Perfect forms are NO FORMS. Nobody wants to fill in a form. They want what's on the other side.
*/
/*
    The most important thing from this listen: 
        - SPEED === CONVERSIONS!!!
