    The App Shell model separates the app's content from its data and ensures that the app gets content on the 
    screen as quickly as possible.

    Then, we'll learn about the service worker and how to use different caching strategies for different needs.

    By the end of the section, our app will use a service worker to cache the app shell and the data so our app 
    works whether the user is online or offline.

    Finally, we'll learn how to make our web app installable via the web app manifest.
